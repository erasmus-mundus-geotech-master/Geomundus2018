# GeoMundus 2018
GeoMundus is a free international symposium organised by the students from the Erasmus Mundus Master's of Science in Geospatial Technologies. The conference aims to share cutting-edge scientific research, knowledge, and skills in the fields of Geospatial Technologies, Geoinformatics, and Geosciences, including but not limited to geographic information systems and sciences, spatial cognition, geography, and spatial data sciences.

This repository contains the resources for the GeoMundus 2018 [website](http://geomundus.org/2018). It's based on a [HTML5 photon template](https://html5up.net/photon), but was heavily modified and modified to suit GeoMundus' needs.
